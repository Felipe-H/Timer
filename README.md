# I have created a timer using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the goal of practicing and improving my skills in these programming languages. The timer is a simple application that allows the user to start, pause, and reset the timer. It also displays the elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

The HTML file contains the basic structure of the timer application, including a div element that displays the elapsed time, buttons for starting, pausing, and resetting the timer, and a script tag that links to the JavaScript file.

The CSS file is used to style the timer application, including the font, color, and layout of the HTML elements.

The JavaScript file contains the logic for the timer application, including starting, pausing, and resetting the timer.

Overall, creating this timer application was a useful exercise in using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS together to create a simple, but functional application.
